# Issue #4: Celery Background Task Processing Implementation

## Task Overview
Implement Celery for background task processing in the backend system to handle long-running operations asynchronously without blocking HTTP requests. This includes email sending, report generation, thumbnail creation, and file cleanup operations.

## Technical Requirements

### Dependencies to Add
- celery>=5.3.0
- redis (already present in requirements.txt)
- flower (for monitoring)
- kombu>=5.3.0

### Infrastructure Integration
- Use Redis as the message broker
- Configure Celery with proper retry mechanisms
- Implement dead letter queue for failed tasks
- Set up monitoring with Flower
- Integrate with existing structured logging system

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Basic Celery Setup
- Install and configure Celery with Redis broker
- Create celery_app instance and configuration
- Set up basic task structure and connection pooling
- Integrate with existing project structure

### Phase 2: Core Task Implementations
- Email sending task with retry logic
- Thumbnail generation for uploaded images
- Periodic file cleanup task
- Health check for Celery workers

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- Dead letter queue implementation
- Exponential backoff for retries
- Celery Beat for periodic tasks
- Graceful shutdown handling
- Monitoring endpoints

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### 1. Celery Integration with Redis/RabbitMQ Broker
- [ ] Configure Celery to use Redis as message broker
- [ ] Implement connection pooling and error handling
- [ ] Set up proper serialization (JSON recommended)
- [ ] Configure worker concurrency settings
- [ ] Add graceful shutdown handling
- [ ] Ensure compatibility with existing Redis connection settings

### 2. Core Tasks Implementation
- [ ] Email sending task with support for templates and attachments
- [ ] Thumbnail generation for image files (multiple sizes)
- [ ] Periodic cleanup of old/temporary files
- [ ] Error handling and logging for each task type
- [ ] Proper input validation for all task parameters

### 3. Celery Beat for Periodic Tasks  
- [ ] Configure Celery Beat for scheduling periodic tasks
- [ ] Implement scheduled cleanup of temporary files
- [ ] Set up periodic health checks
- [ ] Schedule report generation if applicable
- [ ] Implement cron-like scheduling options

### 4. Monitoring and Observability
- [ ] Install and configure Flower for task monitoring
- [ ] Integrate with existing Prometheus metrics
- [ ] Add structured logging to all Celery tasks
- [ ] Ensure request ID correlation between API requests and Celery tasks
- [ ] Set up monitoring endpoints for task statistics

### 5. Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff
- [ ] Configure retry with exponential backoff (starting at 1 minute)
- [ ] Set maximum retry attempts (default 5)
- [ ] Customize retry behavior per task type if needed
- [ ] Log retry attempts with appropriate error details
- [ ] Implement retry for all network-dependent tasks (email, external APIs)

### 6. Dead Letter Queue for Failed Tasks
- [ ] Configure dead letter queue for consistently failing tasks
- [ ] Implement mechanism to move failed tasks after max retries
- [ ] Create process to inspect and handle dead letter queue items
- [ ] Add notifications or alerts for dead letter queue items
- [ ] Provide CLI commands to reprocess failed tasks

### 7. Graceful Shutdown
- [ ] Handle SIGTERM properly to finish current tasks
- [ ] Implement timeout for task completion during shutdown
- [ ] Ensure no tasks are lost during deployment/restart
- [ ] Add health check endpoints for orchestrators like Kubernetes
- [ ] Document the shutdown process for operations team

## Technical Specifications

### Configuration
- Store Celery configuration in environment variables
- Use the same Redis settings as the main application
- Implement proper connection timeout and retry settings
- Set up queues for different task priorities (high, normal, low)

### Integration with Existing Components
- Ensure request ID from API requests is passed to Celery tasks
- Apply structured logging format to all Celery task logs
- Maintain existing authentication/authorization patterns
- Integrate with current error handling and reporting systems

### Security Considerations
- Secure task serialization format
- Validate all inputs to prevent injection attacks
- Use authentication if connecting to external brokers
- Ensure sensitive data is not stored in task queue

## Files to Create/Modify

### New Files:
- `core/celery_app.py` - Main Celery app configuration
- `tasks/email_tasks.py` - Email sending tasks
- `tasks/file_tasks.py` - File processing tasks (thumbnails, cleanup)
- `tasks/periodic_tasks.py` - Scheduled tasks configuration
- `workers/celery_worker.py` - Worker startup script
- `core/middleware/celery_context.py` - Request context propagation

### Modified Files:
- `app.py` - Add Celery integration
- `requirements.txt` - Add Celery dependencies
- `docker-compose.yml` - Add Celery worker and beat services
- `.env.example` - Add Celery configuration variables
- `README.MD` - Update with Celery instructions

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests:
- Test each Celery task individually
- Mock external dependencies in tests
- Verify retry logic behavior
- Test error handling paths

### Integration Tests:
- Test task execution with actual Redis
- Verify request context propagation
- Test periodic task scheduling
- Test graceful shutdown behavior

## Deployment Considerations
- Separate container for Celery workers
- Separate container for Celery Beat scheduler
- Health checks for worker processes
- Monitoring dashboard setup (Flower)
- Configuration for different environments (dev, staging, prod)

## Performance Requirements
- Support for configurable number of worker processes
- Efficient memory usage for long-running tasks
- Proper connection management to Redis
- Monitor task execution times and resource usage

## Deliverables
1. Complete implementation of all acceptance criteria
2. Updated documentation for deployment and usage
3. Unit and integration tests with >80% coverage
4. Configuration for local development and production
5. Instructions for monitoring and troubleshooting
