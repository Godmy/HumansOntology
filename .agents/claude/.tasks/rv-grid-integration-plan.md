# Task: Integrate rv-grid Virtual Grid Library

## Description
Integrate the rv-grid library from https://rv-grid.com/ into the frontend application. This library provides a virtual grid component for Svelte applications that efficiently handles large datasets with smooth scrolling performance and a rich feature set.

## Overview
The rv-grid library would enhance the data display capabilities of the application by providing a high-performance virtual grid that can handle large datasets efficiently. This would be particularly useful for displaying ontology data, metrics, and other structured data in a tabular format with optimal performance even with thousands of rows.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements:
1. **Grid Features:**
   - Virtual scrolling with smooth performance for large datasets
   - Column resizing, reordering, and hiding
   - Cell editing and validation
   - Row selection and highlighting
   - Sorting and filtering capabilities
   - Keyboard navigation support
   - Export to various formats (CSV, Excel, etc.)

2. **Data Integration:**
   - Support for various data formats (JSON, GraphQL responses)
   - Integration with existing data fetching mechanisms
   - Compatibility with Zod for data validation
   - Connection to existing GraphQL endpoints via Houdini

3. **UI/UX:**
   - Responsive design for different screen sizes
   - Integration with existing design system
   - Smooth performance with large datasets (50k+ rows)
   - Customizable styling through TailwindCSS
   - Dark/light mode support

4. **Customization:**
   - Custom cell renderers and formatters
   - Configurable row and column templates
   - Custom styling options
   - Event handling for user interactions
   - Theme support

### Technical Requirements:
1. **Architecture:**
   - Compatible with existing Svelte 5 + TypeScript + runes setup
   - Integrates with TailwindCSS for styling
   - Works with Houdini GraphQL integration
   - Supports SSR (Server-Side Rendering) where applicable

2. **Performance:**
   - Efficient rendering of large datasets through virtualization
   - Minimal memory usage during scrolling
   - Fast initial render times
   - Smooth scrolling at 60fps

3. **Bundle Size:**
   - Minimal impact on overall bundle size
   - Tree-shakable modules if possible
   - Optional features that can be loaded separately

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Research and Assessment
1. Research the rv-grid library and its features
2. Analyze documentation, examples, and source code
3. Determine compatibility with Svelte 5 and current project setup
4. Evaluate bundle size impact
5. Identify potential integration points with existing data sources

### Phase 2: Setup and Installation
1. Install the rv-grid library and any required dependencies
2. Create a basic example component to test functionality
3. Verify TypeScript compatibility
4. Set up development environment for grid development
5. Test with sample data to ensure basic functionality

### Phase 3: Basic Integration
1. Create wrapper components for the grid functionality
2. Integrate with existing data sources (GraphQL endpoints)
3. Implement basic styling to match design system
4. Add basic configuration options
5. Implement error handling and loading states

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
1. Integrate with ontology data for display
2. Add complex cell editing capabilities
3. Implement advanced filtering and sorting
4. Add row selection and action capabilities
5. Create presets for common grid configurations

### Phase 5: Testing and Optimization
1. Test with large datasets to verify performance
2. Test with real ontology data
3. Performance optimization for rendering large grids
4. Accessibility testing
5. Browser compatibility testing

## Technical Considerations

### Potential Challenges:
1. **Data Compatibility:** Ensuring compatibility with existing data structures and GraphQL schema
2. **Performance:** Maintaining smooth performance with very large datasets
3. **Integration:** Connecting with Houdini GraphQL integration and existing data flows
4. **Complexity:** Managing the complexity of grid configuration options
5. **Styling:** Adapting the grid to match existing design system

### Mitigation Strategies:
1. **Progressive Enhancement:** Implement in phases with basic functionality first
2. **Data Transformation:** Create service layer to transform data as needed
3. **Performance Optimization:** Leverage virtualization for efficient rendering
4. **Configuration Management:** Create presets for common use cases
5. **Theming:** Develop wrapper components to handle styling consistency

## Integration Steps

1. **Install the Library:**
   ```bash
   npm install rv-grid
   ```

2. **Create Data Service:**
   - Create service to transform ontology data for grids
   - Connect to GraphQL endpoints via Houdini
   - Implement data validation with Zod

3. **Create Wrapper Components:**
   - Create reusable grid components
   - Ensure consistent styling with TailwindCSS
   - Add default configurations and presets

4. **Integrate with UI:**
   - Add grid view option to data visualization areas
   - Connect to existing navigation and routing
   - Implement state management for grid configurations

5. **Testing and Optimization:**
   - Add performance tests for large datasets
   - Test with real ontology data scenarios
   - Optimize rendering for different data volumes

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Criteria:
1. Grid library is properly installed and functional
2. Basic grid displays data from GraphQL endpoints
3. Integration with existing data sources works correctly
4. TypeScript support functions properly
5. Basic styling matches design system

### Additional Criteria:
1. Performance is acceptable with at least 50,000 data rows
2. Virtual scrolling works smoothly without jank
3. Export functionality works correctly (CSV, Excel)
4. Responsive design works on mobile and desktop
5. Accessibility features are implemented
6. Cell editing and validation work properly
7. Column operations (resize, reorder, hide) function correctly

### Test Scenarios:
1. Basic grid functionality with sample data
2. Integration with GraphQL data sources
3. Performance with large datasets (>50k rows)
4. Responsive behavior on different screen sizes
5. Accessibility features (keyboard navigation, screen readers)
6. Export functionality testing
7. Column operations (resizing, reordering)
