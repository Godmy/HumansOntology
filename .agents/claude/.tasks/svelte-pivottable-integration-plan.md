# Task: Integrate Svelte Pivot Table Library

## Description
Integrate the svelte-pivottable library from https://github.com/jjagielka/svelte-pivottable into the frontend application. This library provides pivot table functionality for Svelte applications, allowing users to analyze and visualize data in a tabular format with dynamic grouping, filtering, and aggregation capabilities.

## Overview
The svelte-pivottable library would enhance the data visualization capabilities of the application by providing interactive pivot tables. This would be particularly useful for analyzing ontology data, metrics, and other structured data in a flexible, user-friendly format that allows for dynamic data exploration.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements:
1. **Pivot Table Features:**
   - Drag-and-drop interface for configuring rows, columns, and values
   - Support for multiple aggregation functions (sum, count, average, etc.)
   - Filtering and sorting capabilities
   - Multiple data display formats
   - Export functionality (CSV, Excel, etc.)

2. **Data Integration:**
   - Support for various data formats (JSON, CSV, GraphQL responses)
   - Integration with existing data fetching mechanisms
   - Compatibility with Zod for data validation
   - Connection to existing GraphQL endpoints via Houdini

3. **UI/UX:**
   - Responsive design for different screen sizes
   - Integration with existing design system
   - Smooth performance with large datasets (10k+ rows)
   - Customizable styling through TailwindCSS
   - Keyboard navigation and accessibility support

4. **Customization:**
   - Configurable rendering of cells, headers, and totals
   - Custom formatting functions for values
   - Ability to add custom actions to cells
   - Theme support (including dark mode)

### Technical Requirements:
1. **Architecture:**
   - Compatible with existing Svelte 5 + TypeScript + runes setup
   - Integrates with TailwindCSS for styling
   - Works with Houdini GraphQL integration
   - Supports SSR (Server-Side Rendering) where applicable

2. **Performance:**
   - Efficient rendering of large datasets
   - Virtual scrolling for performance optimization
   - Lazy loading of data when possible
   - Memory management for large pivot operations

3. **Bundle Size:**
   - Minimal impact on overall bundle size
   - Tree-shakable modules if possible
   - Optional features that can be loaded separately

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Research and Assessment
1. Research the svelte-pivottable library and its features
2. Analyze documentation, examples, and source code
3. Determine compatibility with Svelte 5 and current project setup
4. Evaluate bundle size impact
5. Identify potential integration points with existing data sources

### Phase 2: Setup and Installation
1. Install the svelte-pivottable library and any required dependencies
2. Create a basic example component to test functionality
3. Verify TypeScript compatibility
4. Set up development environment for pivot table development
5. Test with sample data to ensure basic functionality

### Phase 3: Basic Integration
1. Create wrapper components for the pivot table functionality
2. Integrate with existing data sources (GraphQL endpoints)
3. Implement basic styling to match design system
4. Add basic configuration options
5. Implement error handling and loading states

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
1. Integrate with ontology data for analysis
2. Add export functionality for analysis results
3. Implement advanced customization options
4. Add filtering and search capabilities
5. Create presets for common analysis scenarios

### Phase 5: Testing and Optimization
1. Test with large datasets to verify performance
2. Test with real ontology data
3. Performance optimization for rendering large pivot tables
4. Accessibility testing
5. Browser compatibility testing

## Technical Considerations

### Potential Challenges:
1. **Data Compatibility:** Ensuring compatibility with existing data structures and GraphQL schema
2. **Performance:** Handling large datasets efficiently
3. **Integration:** Connecting with Houdini GraphQL integration and existing data flows
4. **Complexity:** Managing the complexity of pivot configuration options
5. **Styling:** Adapting the pivot table to match existing design system

### Mitigation Strategies:
1. **Progressive Enhancement:** Implement in phases with basic functionality first
2. **Data Transformation:** Create service layer to transform data as needed
3. **Performance Optimization:** Implement virtual scrolling and data chunking
4. **Configuration Management:** Create presets for common use cases
5. **Theming:** Develop wrapper components to handle styling consistency

## Integration Steps

1. **Install the Library:**
   ```bash
   npm install svelte-pivottable
   ```

2. **Create Data Service:**
   - Create service to transform ontology data for pivot tables
   - Connect to GraphQL endpoints via Houdini
   - Implement data validation with Zod

3. **Create Wrapper Components:**
   - Create reusable pivot table components
   - Ensure consistent styling with TailwindCSS
   - Add default configurations and presets

4. **Integrate with UI:**
   - Add pivot table view option to data visualization areas
   - Connect to existing navigation and routing
   - Implement state management for pivot configurations

5. **Testing and Optimization:**
   - Add performance tests for large datasets
   - Test with real ontology data scenarios
   - Optimize rendering for different data volumes

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Criteria:
1. Pivot table library is properly installed and functional
2. Basic pivot table displays data from GraphQL endpoints
3. Integration with existing data sources works correctly
4. TypeScript support functions properly
5. Basic styling matches design system

### Additional Criteria:
1. Performance is acceptable with at least 10,000 data rows
2. Export functionality works correctly (CSV, Excel)
3. Drag-and-drop interface functions properly
4. Responsive design works on mobile and desktop
5. Accessibility features are implemented
6. Configuration presets are available for common use cases

### Test Scenarios:
1. Basic pivot table functionality with sample data
2. Integration with GraphQL data sources
3. Performance with large datasets (>10k rows)
4. Responsive behavior on different screen sizes
