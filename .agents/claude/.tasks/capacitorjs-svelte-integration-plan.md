# Task: Integrate Capacitor.js with Svelte Frontend

## Description
Integrate Capacitor.js with the existing Svelte frontend application to enable cross-platform development (mobile apps, desktop apps, and web). This will allow the frontend to run as native applications on iOS, Android, and desktop platforms while reusing the existing Svelte codebase.

## Overview
Capacitor.js is an official solution for Svelte applications that provides native functionality and cross-platform capabilities. It allows Svelte applications to access native APIs and be packaged as native applications for iOS, Android, macOS, and Windows.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements:
1. **Cross-Platform Support:**
   - Package the Svelte application as native iOS and Android apps
   - Support for desktop applications (macOS, Windows, Linux)
   - Maintain all existing functionality on web platform

2. **Native API Access:**
   - Device hardware access (camera, GPS, accelerometer, etc.)
   - Native UI controls and gestures
   - Push notifications
   - File system access
   - Device storage and synchronization

3. **Performance:**
   - Smooth performance matching native application standards
   - Efficient use of device resources
   - Minimize loading times

4. **User Experience:**
   - Native-like appearance and feel on each platform
   - Proper handling of platform-specific UI guidelines
   - Offline support where applicable

### Technical Requirements:
1. **Compatibility:**
   - Integrate with existing Svelte 5 application
   - Maintain compatibility with houdini GraphQL integration
   - Preserve existing build processes and tooling

2. **Build Process:**
   - Add Capacitor build steps to existing Vite/SvelteKit workflow
   - Separate configurations for web, mobile, and desktop builds
   - Optimize bundle size for mobile platforms

3. **Code Structure:**
   - Implement conditional logic for native vs web features
   - Organize platform-specific code appropriately
   - Maintain clean separation between shared and platform-specific code

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Setup and Configuration
1. Install Capacitor.js and required dependencies
2. Initialize Capacitor project in the frontend directory
3. Configure Capacitor for Svelte 5 application
4. Update build scripts to support Capacitor builds
5. Set up platform-specific configuration files

### Phase 2: Platform Integration
1. Add iOS platform support
2. Add Android platform support
3. Test basic application functionality on both platforms
4. Configure app icons, splash screens, and other platform assets
5. Implement platform-specific UI adjustments

### Phase 3: Native Feature Integration
1. Implement camera functionality for device photo capture
2. Add GPS/location services for location-aware features
3. Implement push notifications
4. Add file system access for offline data storage
5. Integrate device storage for offline capabilities

### Phase 4: Performance Optimization
1. Optimize bundle size for mobile platforms
2. Implement lazy loading for platform-specific features
3. Optimize assets for various device screen densities
4. Test performance on various devices
5. Address any performance bottlenecks

### Phase 5: Testing and Deployment
1. Comprehensive testing on iOS and Android devices
2. Performance testing on various device types
3. Prepare app store deployment packages
4. Document the Capacitor integration process
5. Create deployment scripts for various platforms

## Technical Considerations

### Potential Challenges:
1. **State Management:** Ensuring proper state handling across web and native platforms
2. **Routing:** Adapting client-side routing for native app navigation patterns
3. **API Calls:** Handling network requests differently based on platform capabilities
4. **Build Complexity:** Managing separate builds for web, mobile, and desktop
5. **Platform Differences:** Handling platform-specific UI/UX guidelines

### Mitigation Strategies:
1. **Gradual Migration:** Implement Capacitor integration incrementally
2. **Feature Detection:** Use feature detection to conditionally enable native features
3. **Shared Services:** Create abstraction layers for platform-specific functionality
4. **Comprehensive Testing:** Establish testing procedures for each platform
5. **Documentation:** Maintain clear documentation for the integration

## Integration Steps

1. **Install Capacitor:**
   ```bash
   npm install @capacitor/core @capacitor/cli
   npx cap init
   ```

2. **Add Svelte Platform Plugin:**
   ```bash
   npm install @capacitor-community/svelte
   ```

3. **Configure Capacitor:**
   - Create capacitor.config.ts
   - Configure platform-specific settings
   - Set up web directory path

4. **Adapt Build Process:**
   - Modify vite.config.ts to support Capacitor builds
   - Add platform-specific build scripts
   - Update package.json scripts

5. **Platform-Specific Setup:**
   - Add iOS platform: `npx cap add ios`
   - Add Android platform: `npx cap add android`

6. **Native API Integration:**
   - Install required Capacitor plugins
   - Implement native functionality in Svelte components
   - Create service layer for native features

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Criteria:
1. Svelte application builds and runs successfully as native iOS and Android apps
2. All existing functionality is preserved in native applications
3. Native APIs are accessible and functional
4. Application follows platform-specific UI/UX guidelines
5. Build process integrates smoothly with existing workflow

### Additional Criteria:
1. Performance meets native application standards
2. Offline functionality works where applicable
3. Cross-platform code sharing is maximized
4. Platform-specific code is properly organized
5. Documentation is provided for the integration process

### Test Scenarios:
1. Build and run the application on iOS simulator/device
2. Build and run the application on Android emulator/device
3. Test native functionality (camera, location, etc.)
4. Verify all existing features work in native environment
5. Performance testing on low-end devices
6. Offline functionality testing
7. App store submission requirements validation

## Timeline
- Estimate: 7-10 days depending on complexity of native features
- Priority: High (enables mobile and desktop distribution)
